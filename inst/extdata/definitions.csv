Term,Description
Accountability,Answerability or legal responsibility for  identifying and removing obstacles and  barriers to health  services. This should  include responding to findings from  monitoring and evaluation (1).
Accuracy,"The degree to which a  measurement, test  or procedure correctly reflect the true  value or condition (2)."
Delineated geographical areas within,"a particular territory created for the  purpose of  administration. For  example:  county, district, province, state, region,  subnational or national (3)."
Age groupings,The combining of ages into groups for  the purpose of data  analysis. These  groupings usually capture a time interval  representing a developmental stage in  the life course of a  human. The actual  aggregation used depends on the purpose  of the analysis and the sample size (4).
Age-specific mortality rate,A mortality rate of a particular age  group.  The numerator is the number of deaths  in that age  group; the denominator is the  number of persons in that age group in the  population (5).B
Birth registration data,Data collected in the process of recording  a child’s  birth. It is a permanent and  official record of a  child’s existence and  provides legal recognition of that  child’s  identity (6).
Care cascade,"A systematic framework used to track  patient outcomes across the stages  of care, from diagnosis to treatment and  ultimately to successful  outcomes. Each  stage in the cascade identifies gaps in care  that can prevent individuals from reaching  the outcome such as receiving proper  treatment or achieving disease  control.  The model was first developed in 1978 by  Tanahasi to identify gaps and barriers in  health systems performance (7,8)."
Catchment area,"A geographical area delineated around  an institution or  business, such as a  health  facility, from where the population  utilizes its  services. Often a key output of  geographic accessibility analysis (see also “geographic  accessibility”) (9)."

A confounding variable is an  additional variable that influences both  the independent and dependent variables  and that distorts the relationship between  them (17).
Construct validity,"The degree to which a measurement   aligns with related theoretical  hypotheses,  demonstrating that it accurately represents  the underlying theoretical  concept. It  indicates how well the scores reflect the  intended  construct, ensuring the results  are meaningful and  relevant. Construct  validity is commonly applied to process  indicators (18).A"

Numerator,Count of values captured by the indicator  in a specified  population. The upper  portion of a fraction used to calculate a  rate or ratio (5).
Odds ratio,"A measure of association between an  exposure and an  outcome. It represents  the odds (or  probability) that an outcome  will occur given a particular  exposure,  compared to the odds of the outcome  occurring in the absence of that  exposure.  The numerator is the proportion of the  event of  interest, and the denominator is  the proportion of the  non-event (23)."
Outcome-adjusted coverage,"The proportion of a population that  benefits from an intervention after  considering the quality or effectiveness  of the  intervention. In this  measure,  coverage is not just about access to  services but also reflects whether the  intervention had a positive health  impact. It adjusts traditional intervention coverage estimates by incorporating the  actual outcomes of the health services  provided (8)."
Outcome indicator,"Measures whether the programme is  achieving the expected  effects/changes  in the  short, intermediate and long  term,  such as changes in intervention coverage  or health-related  behaviours. Some  programmes refer to their  longest-term/ most distal outcome indicators as impact  indicators (21)."
Output indicator,"Measures the immediate products provided or services delivered as a  result of the processes conducted in a  programme or  project, such as number  of persons  trained, number of children  vaccinated (21,116)."
Percentage,Number or ratio that can be expressed as a  fraction of 100 (117).
Periodicity,"Data can be compiled continuously in  systems such as civil  registries, cancer  registries and surveillance systems  of reportable  diseases. Data can also  be compiled  periodically, which is  to say at regular intervals or without  predefined  periodicity, and at a particular  point in time (23).A"
Population attributable fraction,The proportional reduction in population  disease or mortality would occur if  exposure to a risk factor were reduced to  an alternative ideal exposure  scenario. The  number of deaths and DALYs attributed  to a risk factor is quantified by applying  the population attributable fraction to the  total number of deaths or the total burden  of disease (118).

Population census,"Is the total process of  planning, collecting,  compiling, evaluating, disseminating and  analysing  demographic, economic and  social data at the smallest geographic  level  pertaining, at a specified  time, to all  persons in a country or in a  well-delimited  part of a country (119)."
Positive predictive value,"Is the probability that following a positive  test  result, a given individual will truly  have that specific  disease. It is defined as  the number of true positives (people who  test positive and have a  condition) divided  by the total number of people who test  positive (113)."
Predictive validity,"The degree to which predictions are  confirmed by facts expressed in terms  of its ability to predict future outcomes  or events. Predictive validity is often used  for impact indicators (25).Preferred data sources The recommended source of data  for a specific health  indicator.

Process of validation,A description of how the indicator was  validated to assess how accurately it  measures what it is intended to  do. This  glossary includes some methods for  validation (122).
Processed health data,"Health statistics that have been  calculated from raw health  data, but are  not the result of synthesizing multiple  data  sources. Examples of processing  raw health data include cleaning data by  removing implausible  values, calculating  an indicator with an  algorithm, or  adjusting a statistic for bias (24).A Z16"
Proportion,"The  size, number or amount of one thing  or group as compared to the  size, number  or amount of  another, when the numerator  is a subset of the denominator (23)."

P value,The probability that a statistic would be as  extreme as or more extreme than observed  if the null hypothesis were true (17).
Quality-adjusted coverage,"An assessment metric that evaluates how  effectively a health intervention reaches a  target population and the quality of care  that is  provided. This measure combines  intervention coverage rates with quality  measures to better understand the overall  impact of health programmes (8,125,126).R"
Rate,"An expression of the frequency with which  an event occurs in a defined  population,  usually in a specified period of  time. The  components of a rate are the  numerator,  the denominator, the specified time  in which events  occur, and usually  a multiplier, that converts the rate from  a fraction or decimal to a whole  number.  The numerator is the absolute number of  occurrences of the event being studied  in a specified  time. The denominator is  the reference population (or population  being  studied) at the same time (17,23)."
Ratio,"The result of dividing one quantity by  another without regard for details such as  a time  dimension. Rates, proportions and  percentages are all types of  ratios. The  distinction between a proportion and a  ratio is  that, whereas the numerator of a  proportion is included in the population  defined by the  denominator, this is not  necessarily so for a  ratio, which expresses  the relationship of two separate and  distinct  quantities, neither of which is  included in the other (17)."

Registry,"A collection of information about  individuals, usually focused  on a specific diagnosis or  conditions.  Registry data is stored in a database and  can provide health care providers and  researchers with  first-hand information  about people with specific  conditions,  both individually and as a  group, and  over  time. Patient registries are different  from health facility registers in that the  former collect patient information that  is disease- or  condition-specific whereas  the later collect information about the  patient regardless of their condition or  disease (130)."

Results framework,"A diagram that maps the direct causal  relationships between incremental steps  or results of key activities all the way up  to the overall objective and goal of the  programme or  intervention. It includes  an overall  goal, strategic  objectives, and  intermediate results (100,101).A Z18"
Routine data,"Data generated as part of regular  operational or administrative processes  within the health care  system. These  data are systematically collected during  the delivery of health services and the  management of health  facilities. Routine   data includes patient  demographics,  health  conditions, treatments and   outcomes recorded in health facility   registers, electronic health  records, and  health management information  systems.  It also covers information related to health  service  resources, such as  infrastructure,   human  resources, and financial   transactions. The primary purpose of  routine data is to support daily  operations,  monitor service  delivery, and facilitate    decision-making across various levels of  the health  system. This is also referred to  as administrative data (134,135)."
Routine health information system,"A system that generates data collected  at public and private health facilities  and  institutions, and at  community-level  health care posts and clinics – at regular  intervals of a year at  minimum. The data  give a picture of health  status, health  services and health  resources. Most of the  data are gathered by health care  providers,  by supervisors and through routine health  facility  surveys. The sources of those data  are generally individual health  records,  records of services  delivered, and resource  health records including  financial,  commodity or laboratory records (51,86)."
Sample,Sample is a subset of a population (136).
Sample size,"Refers to the number of observations or  data points gathered from a population for  statistical  analysis. It is a critical element of research  design, significantly affecting  the reliability and validity of a  study’s  findings (17)."

Secondary data,"Data that was originally collected for  other  purposes. The data from these  existing sources are considered  secondary.  Although these data were not created for  the purpose at  hand, they facilitate the  development of the required  indicators.  Data from a  census, research,  information  system, etc. are secondary  data (23)."
Sensitivity analysis,"A systematic approach to evaluate how  the variation in the output of a system or  model can be attributed to different  sources of variation in its  inputs. It involves  examining the sensitivity of the  model’s  outcomes or outputs to changes in  individual input  parameters, providing  insights into the relative importance of  each parameter in influencing the overall  results (138)."

Survey,A structured list of questions that collect  data on a specific population (117).
Survey data,A survey is an investigation about the  characteristics of a given population by  means of collecting data from a sample  of that population and estimating their  characteristics through the systematic use  of statistical methodology (145).
Sustainability,"The  source’s potential to remain relevant  and be of the quality needed to generate  information over  time. This depends  not only on the periodicity of the  data  collection, but on the availability of  the financial resources needed to sustain  that source of  data, the presence of a  legal  framework, political  will, among  other factors (23)."
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),"These are 17 global objectives that were  agreed by Member States of the United  Nations and aim to transform our  world.  They are a call to action to end poverty  and  inequality, protect the  planet, and  ensure that all people enjoy  health, justice  and  prosperity. It is critical that no one is  left behind (104)."
Target population,"A population about which information  is wanted and estimates are  required. It  can be a group of individuals who meet  specific criteria for inclusion in a  survey.  In relation to health  care, it is often a  group of individuals in need of a specific  intervention or service (146).A Z20"
Timeliness,"When the data is quickly available  and accessible for  use. In the context  of data  quality, the degree to which  reports are submitted on time according  to established  deadlines. Timeliness  involves the availability and reliability  of the data at the time it is needed to  construct related  indicators. Thus, timely  indicators provide better opportunities for  making  health-related decisions (13,23,66)."

Transparency,"Any information or communication relating to the processing of personal  data is easily accessible and easy  to understand, and that clear and plain  language be  used. Individuals should be  made aware of  risks, rules, safeguards  and rights in relation to the processing of  personal data and how to exercise their  rights in relation to such processing (147)."
Trend,A pattern found in multiple standardized  measurements over  time; it is used to  describe if the data is showing an upward  or downward movement for a specified  time period (148).
Uncertainty measure,"Relates to how the estimate might differ  from the “true  value” .  Common measures  of uncertainty include standard  error,  standard  deviation, confidence  interval,  coefficient of variation and statistical  significance (149).Understandable/Simplicity When an indicator is presented in a  clear,  concise and easily comprehensible  way.  The indicator must be understood by   those responsible for taking action  and,   specifically, by those responsible for   decision-making (23,60)."
Unit of measure,Unit of measure in which the indicator is  presented (e.g. deaths per 1000 live  births;  US$; litres per person per  year). Note:  Percentage is not considered a  unit of measure and indicators that are  presented as percentages should have  the unit of measure field filled in as ‘n/a’
Usefulness/Utility,If the indicator is useful for programme  improvement and policy issues (60).

Vital event,"Events that are captured through civil  registration and vital statistic  systems,  which usually include live  birth, death,  fetal  death, marriage, divorce, annulment  of marriage, judicial separation  of marriage, adoption, legitimation,  recognition of  parenthood, or change of  name or nationality (151)."
Vital statistics,"The systematic record of vital events such  as birth, marriage, divorce, adoption,  death, and cause of death to generate data  and statistics (152)."
Weighting,"A technique used to adjust data to reflect  the known population  profile. It is used  to balance out any significant variance  between actual and target  profile.  Weighted analyses of  population-based  surveys allow us to generalize findings  to a larger or more general  population.  This approach aims to provide unbiased  estimates of descriptive statistics or  model parameters of the population  of interest, which may be a general  population or major population  subgroup.  Incorporating weights in the analyses can  be crucial to achieve statistically  valid,  representative  population-based findings  in surveys and to make adjustments for  sampling errors (153).Y"
Years of life lost,Represents the loss of one year of  life.  Years of life lost are calculated from the  number of deaths multiplied by a global  standard life expectancy at the age at  which death occurs (154).
Years lived with disability,Represents the equivalent of one full year  of healthy life lost due to disability or  ill- health. The prevalence of years lived with  disability are calculated as the prevalence  of each  non-fatal condition multiplied by  its disability weight (155).A Z22     Glossary terms by related thematic  areas Users of this glossary may wish to know which terms align with different data concepts or  thematic  areas.
