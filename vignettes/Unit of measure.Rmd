# Unit of measure

Unit of measure in which the indicator is  presented (e.g. deaths per 1000 live  births;  US$; litres per person per  year). Note:  Percentage is not considered a  unit of measure and indicators that are  presented as percentages should have  the unit of measure field filled in as ‘n/a’
