# Confounding

Occurs when the relationship between  an exposure and an outcome is distorted  because the exposure is linked to other  factors that also affect the likelihood of  the outcome. A confounding variable is an  additional variable that influences both  the independent and dependent variables  and that distorts the relationship between  them (17).
