# Data standards

The rules for structuring information  that has been  collected, and which  facilitate semantic  interoperability. A set  of agreed data standards ensures that  the data entered into a system can be  reliably  read, sorted, indexed, retrieved  and communicated between  systems.  For example, length of a  field, format,  the encoding of the  information, and  permissible values (47).
