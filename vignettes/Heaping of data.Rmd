# Heaping of data

A measure of the tendency of respondents  to report numerical values using preferred  numbers or specific intervals when  providing  estimates, such as age of  disease diagnosis or date of events (e.g.  birthweights reported on 2000g or  2500g)  or rounded (i.e. ending in ‘00’ or ‘50’) (89).
