# Health inequity

Unfair, avoidable or remediable differences in health among groups  of people. In some  cases, the absence  of a difference between groups  (that  is, a situation of  equality) might be  considered  inequitable. Health inequity  is rooted in the unfair distribution  of,  and access  to, power, wealth and other  social  resources, and is linked to forms of  disadvantage that are socially  produced,  such as  poverty, discrimination and lack of  access to services or goods (83).
