# Construct validity

The degree to which a measurement   aligns with related theoretical  hypotheses,  demonstrating that it accurately represents  the underlying theoretical  concept. It  indicates how well the scores reflect the  intended  construct, ensuring the results  are meaningful and  relevant. Construct  validity is commonly applied to process  indicators (18).A
