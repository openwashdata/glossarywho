# Outcome indicator

Measures whether the programme is  achieving the expected  effects/changes  in the  short, intermediate and long  term,  such as changes in intervention coverage  or health-related  behaviours. Some  programmes refer to their  longest-term/ most distal outcome indicators as impact  indicators (21).
