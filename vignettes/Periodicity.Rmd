# Periodicity

Data can be compiled continuously in  systems such as civil  registries, cancer  registries and surveillance systems  of reportable  diseases. Data can also  be compiled  periodically, which is  to say at regular intervals or without  predefined  periodicity, and at a particular  point in time (23).A
