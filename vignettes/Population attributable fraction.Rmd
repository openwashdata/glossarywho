# Population attributable fraction

The proportional reduction in population  disease or mortality would occur if  exposure to a risk factor were reduced to  an alternative ideal exposure  scenario. The  number of deaths and DALYs attributed  to a risk factor is quantified by applying  the population attributable fraction to the  total number of deaths or the total burden  of disease (118).
