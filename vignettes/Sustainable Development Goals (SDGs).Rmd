# Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

These are 17 global objectives that were  agreed by Member States of the United  Nations and aim to transform our  world.  They are a call to action to end poverty  and  inequality, protect the  planet, and  ensure that all people enjoy  health, justice  and  prosperity. It is critical that no one is  left behind (104).
