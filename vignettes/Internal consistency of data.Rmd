# Internal consistency of data

A measure based on the correlations  between different items on the same  test or  survey. It measures whether  several items that propose to measure  the same general construct produce  similar scores or  results. For  example, if a  respondent answered “Do you consider  yourself  healthy?” as  yes, and then in the  same survey answered “Do you consider  yourself  unhealthy?” as  no, that is good  internal consistency (94).
