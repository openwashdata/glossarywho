# Mortality data

Information on the number of deaths  caused by an event or illness in a specified  time  period. Measuring how many people  die each year and why they have died  is one of the most informative ways of  assessing the effectiveness of a  countryâ€™s  health  system. These data allow health  authorities to evaluate how they prioritize  public health programmes (10).N
