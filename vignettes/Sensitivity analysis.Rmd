# Sensitivity analysis

A systematic approach to evaluate how  the variation in the output of a system or  model can be attributed to different  sources of variation in its  inputs. It involves  examining the sensitivity of the  modelâ€™s  outcomes or outputs to changes in  individual input  parameters, providing  insights into the relative importance of  each parameter in influencing the overall  results (138).
