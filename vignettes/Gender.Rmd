# Gender

Refers to the characteristics of  women,   men, girls and boys that are socially    constructed. This includes  norms,  behaviours and roles associated with  being a  woman, man, girl or  boy, as  well as relationships with each  other. As  a social  construct, gender varies from  society to society and can change over  time (68).
